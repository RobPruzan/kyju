goal:

- get a remote hook working with server
- need some sort of client def/ server def?
- uh actually don't need to worry about type defs/ deps, just need a hardcoded example
- need to serialize fn, send it over, make kyju available in scope during creation
- when running hooks, need to bind it to the fiber that called it somehow
- can access it with useState init value, so can just pass an id
- that can just be a global map, i don't think we need any tree structure
- there is no concept of components so yeah
- idk if we need useDistributedContext for the demo, but i guess fine to consider
- need some sort of concept of remote component call
- can have a leaf that runs under the kyju entrypoint
- reading needs to publish to a subscription via ws
- that needs to generate a spec for a component + hook calls
- which will be a kyju context read, which is wrapping useContext plus a way to discover the context to pass to useContext
- means when we createDistributedContext we need a registry of tags to context, so we can just map
- life cycle of the effect?
- messaging with context is important
- state updates propagated, state sets dispatched
- update i guess is more important for now w.r.t effect life cycle
- obviously needs to get sent over the message boundary
- life cycles are definitely a little wack (bc async networking), but the semantics shouldn't be awful
- can just send changed state in render fn if changed to live sync value, pretty easy
- sending back a little more complex
- all functions (deeply) in context need to be an rpc, that get executed on the client
- er yeah that's about it i guess
