- high level goals
-
- - performant/ergonomic API's for web stuff from a devtool perspective
- - stuff like interaction tracker should be ported here
- - network tracker
- - UI components for devtool stuff that actually feels good to use
- - most of react scan general logic encompassed by kyju
- - canvas overlays
- - server API's
- - iframe API's
- - it would be sick if it crossed iframe boundary automatically
- - like imagine we can make react scan work cross iframe because of those API's
- - and can use in zenbu
- - web worker stuff
- - easily deployable to NPM correctly: bunchee seems to fix that
- - testing framework setup
- - state management stuff
- - inject other UI in it that grows to it and doesn't look out of place (solves multi devtool problem)
- - websocket based communication
- - overhead tracking and profiling for the devtool itself (maybe I can hook into chrome devtools for that, i'll have the ability to talk to seb)
- - extension support?
- - routing (this sounds like a lot but just simple devtool level routing that supports transitions perhaps and other stuff routing libs solve)
- - assets
- - shadow dom
- - maybe it should be an iframe that communicates back to the parent? Not sure can explore that further
- - throttling/batched updates back to server
- - session replay thing in here
- - gooey magnetic bar
- - tailwind automatically setup
- - inspect element stuff
- - things that LLM app builders want to create
- - hotkey daemon
- - local storage migrations
-
-
-
- what would this look like to consume?
-
- some parts really don't need to be composable and can just be pure functions you run (maybe it should have some common api?)
-
- some parts should probably be composable but incrementally adoptable? Like
- state management and routing, reactivity etc, iframe communication
-
- the ui stuff should probably be composable with state management/routing
-
- the migration stuff too that needs to be
-
- same for the profiling stuff it needs to get everything to be right
-
- server API's need to be good this is quite tricky and needs to handle all the cases you might have (think million lint)
-
- stacking stuff should be clear
-
- visual edits should be trivial if the API is built right, should not be hard
-
- everything should hot reload, so that's a starter we need, and we can do all of that for package management, hot reloading, web workers, fast build tools etc

goals next, make a interaction tracking devtool, maybe networking?

make it really good, dnd/magnetic/routing etc with react scan functionality
